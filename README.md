This was a project to learn Python and test my skills, so the code may be a bit messy.

A SoundBoard for usage with Voicemeeter, which allows the user to play sounds through discord, teamspeak etc. Purely written in Python with the usage of tkinter/customtkinter.

To run it just run the main.py file.

It is highly recommended to also have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed.

Required libraries:
  -  customtkinter==4.1.0
  -  Pillow==9.5.0
  -  pydub==0.25.1
  -  pygame==2.4.0
  -  pynput==1.7.6
  -  PyYAML==6.0
  -  youtube_dl==2021.12.17
