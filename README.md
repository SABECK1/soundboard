This was a project to learn Python and test my skills, so the code may be a bit messy.

A SoundBoard for usage with Voicemeeter, which allows the user to play sounds through discord, teamspeak etc. Purely written in Python with the usage of tkinter/customtkinter.

To run it just run the main.py file.

It is highly recommended to also have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed.

Required libraries:
- pygame
- pyaml
- customtkinter
- pynput
